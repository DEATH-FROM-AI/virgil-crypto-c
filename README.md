# Virgil Security Crypto library for C

This library is designed to be small, flexible and convenient wrapper for a variety crypto algorithms.
So it can be used in a small micro controller as well as in a high load server application.

Also it provides a bunch of custom hybrid algorithms that combines different crypto algorithms to solve common cryptographic problems.
That eliminates requirement for developers to have a strong cryptographic skills.
